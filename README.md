This project translates natural language queries into SQL statements. It is designed to help users interact with databases using plain English, making data access more intuitive and user-friendly.

## Features
- Convert natural language questions to SQL queries
- Support for multiple SQL dialects (planned)
- Easy integration with existing databases

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   # Replace with actual run command
